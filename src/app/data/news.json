Positive statements about improving Brexit could lead to a slight increase in the value of UK-based companies heavily reliant on EU trade, reducing existing uncertainty. However, negative news or lack of clarity could lead to a decrease.  The overall impact will likely be modest given that Brexit has been ongoing for several years and the market has largely adapted."
