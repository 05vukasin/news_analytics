This includes major players in AI software (e.g., NVDA (Nvidia), MSFT (Microsoft), GOOG (Google/Alphabet)), semiconductor manufacturers (e.g., TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), INTC (Intel), AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)), and potentially cloud computing companies (e.g., AMZN (Amazon), IBM).  The specific impact will depend on each company's existing AI strategies and reliance on high-end chip technology.  Chinese companies involved in AI development, if publicly traded, would also be significantly affected, though identifying specific tickers requires further information about the startup mentioned in the BBC article."

If DeepSeek proves to be a genuinely disruptive technology with superior capabilities, it could trigger a significant shift in the AI landscape.  This could lead to both winners (companies successfully adapting or partnering) and losers (those lagging behind technologically).  Initial negative reactions could be due to uncertainty and fear of competition, with potential for a later rebound depending on DeepSeek's actual capabilities and market adoption."
